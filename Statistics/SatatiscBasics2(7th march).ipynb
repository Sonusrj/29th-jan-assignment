    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, provide information about the spread or variability of a dataset.\n",
    "`Range`:\n",
    "1. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "2. It provides a basic measure of the total extent or spread of the data.\n",
    "3. A larger range indicates a wider spread, while a smaller range suggests a narrower spread.\n",
    "4. However, the range only considers the extreme values and doesn't account for the distribution of values in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of exam scores: [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]. The range is calculated as 90 - 70 = 20, indicating a spread of 20 points between the highest and lowest scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Variance`:\n",
    "1. Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "2. It takes into account all the data points and provides a more comprehensive measure of dispersion.\n",
    "3. A higher variance suggests a greater spread or variability in the dataset.\n",
    "4. A lower variance indicates a more concentrated or less dispersed dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using the same exam scores dataset, the variance can be calculated. Assuming it represents the entire population, the population variance formula is used. After calculations, the variance is found to be 62.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Standard Deviation`:\n",
    "1. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "2. It represents the average distance of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "3. Like variance, a higher standard deviation suggests a greater spread or variability.\n",
    "4. A lower standard deviation suggests a more concentrated or less dispersed dataset.\n",
    "5. It is often preferred over variance as it is in the same unit as the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using the same exam scores dataset, the standard deviation can be calculated. Taking the square root of the variance (62.5), we find that the standard deviation is approximately 7.91.\n"
