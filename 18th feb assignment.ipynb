The api sends information about user's order and  payment information to the payment gatway, which then process the payment and sends back a response to website."

    "`Advantages`: \n",
    "1) Improved Efficency : APIs enable different software application to communicate and share data with each other , leading to increased efficiency and productivity.\n",
    "2) Flexibility: APIs allows developers to create new applications that can use the feature and data of other application, making it easier to create complex sysytem.\n",

    "`Web API`: A web api is type of API that uses HTTP or HTTPS protocols to communicate with web-based software applicatons. It is essentially a set of protocols and tools for building software application that allows web application to interact with each other over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Difference`:\n",
    "1) The main difference between API and Web API is that APIs can be used to enable communication between any two software applications, whereas Web APIs are specifically designed to allow communication between web-based software applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) APIs can be used for various purposes, including communication between desktop and mobile applications, or between server-side applications. On the other hand, Web APIs are primarily used for enabling communication between web-based applications, such as web browsers, web servers, and web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Another key difference between API and Web API is the protocol used for communication. While APIs can use a variety of protocols for communication, including TCP/IP, FTP, and SMTP, Web APIs use HTTP or HTTPS protocols for communication."

    "1) Performance: SOAP messages are typically larger and more complex than REST messages, which can lead to slower performance, especially over slow or unreliable network connections.\n",
